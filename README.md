### Hello world ðŸ‘‹
My name is Harsimran (pronounced: her-sim-run). If you find it hard to pronounce or get it wrong, don't sweat - I won't be offended (most of the time :wink:). Friends call me Harsimran, Maan or HSM - whichever they find convenient.

I am a Liverpool fan and try not to miss their games. If you have found me after reading my prediction about Liverpool in a secret passphrase in a datacenter in Germany - I am your guy(and yes I got it right :wink:). If you are not a Liverpool fan and have been annoyed by multiple references to Liverpool players or staff in the [API docs](https://help.sap.com/viewer/0c27a319979d4e409efc3d6224e8ed37/LATEST/en-US/707edaade9c34f59a8c803d4565f2645.html) at a multinational Enterprise, just know that no humans were harmed in the making of those (and yes, I love my work too :smile:).

I am here because I believe in the power of open source and open collaboration. Over the years, I have managed to bring many engineering and collaboration practices/patterns to enterprises. Most of my successes in my life are built around the support that I have received from family, friends, colleagues and people I met through various open forums. Over the years, I have had the pleasure of mentoring many engineers, a few startups and volunteering at a few non-profits ( including the one where I met my lovely wife :heart: ).

I have had my fair share of successes and failures with software & technology and might have opinions and bias as a result. In a natural reaction to counter my bias, I am not afraid to try something new or to accept another viewpoint. Looking forward to collaborating with you.
